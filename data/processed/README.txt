The list of sub-indicators available for the wildfire smoke indicator is as follows:
1. attributable_country.csv: Annual estimated attributable deaths + 95% CI to wildfire-PM2.5 by country and year. Many countries have irregular time series due to mortality data availability.
2. attributable_nuts.csv: Annual estimated attributable deaths + 95% CI to wildfire-PM2.5 by NUTS 2 and year. Many NUTS units have irregular time series due to mortality data availability.
3. attributable_euro.csv: Annual estimated Europe-wide attributable deaths + 95% CI to wildfire-PM2.5 by year. Use with caution, the country availability is different by year (check attributable_country file to see it). 
4. expo1ug_nuts.csv: Annual number of days/year where population-weighted wildfire-PM2.5 > 1ug/m3 by NUTS 2 and year.
5. expo_euro.csv: Annual average Europe-wide population-weighted wildfire-PM2.5 (ug/m3) by year.
6. expo_region.csv: Annual average population-weighted wildfire-PM2.5 (ug/m3) by European region (N, S, W, C and E) and year.
7. expo_country.csv: Annual average population-weighted wildfire-PM2.5 (ug/m3) by country and year.
